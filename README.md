  4. SVProgressHUD. show loader for calling api and waiting time
  5. IQKeyboardManagerSwift.  handle the keyboard stuff.

i did see any bug or crash but there are a no of improvement that may be under working in future as i said i was busy so i did spend time on this.
### Any improvements you see that can be made in the app 
colour scheme and text on the app should be improved and before starting the game there should be rules and regulation that user must know, a popup with this type of stuff, i have design but not showing due to time and content that have to show
